        kiwi is not afruit-that's kiwifruit, which is native to eastern Asia! About the

            <h4 id="h4-1">The kiwi lives in forested areas of New Zealand that tend
                to be very steep and wet, surrounded by shrubs and trees
                found nowhere else on Earth. Since it is not able to fly up
                into trees to nest, rest, or escape from danger, the kiwi
                makes its home in burrows in the ground of its swampy
                forest or grassland habitat. The bird digs multiple burrows
                within its territory, using strong toes and claws. Nest
                burrows, dug early in the season, become overgrown at
                the entrance to provide great camouflage by the time the
                female is ready to lay her eggs.</h4>

            <h4 id="h4-1">Kiwi pairs use gentle grunts and snuffles with each other and their chicks, and males purr
                during
                mating. Pairs
                do fight, and the larger female may kick the male away if she is not in the mood for his company. If
                another
                kiwi invades a pairâ€™s territory, a kicking fight ensues, and kiwis have been known to fight to the
                death,
                although this is rare.
            </h4>
            <h4 id="h4-1">
                An adult male and female kiwi typically pair for life, but a female may choose a new male if a more
                desirable
                one wanders by. The male doesn't have beautiful songs or fancy feathers to attract a female.
                Instead, he follows
                one around constantly while grunting. If she's not interested, the female might wander off or try to
                scare him
                away.
                Breeding season is late winter to early summer. Nests might be in hollow logs or in underground
                burrows dug by
                the male.
            </h4>
            <h4 id="h4-1">
                The female kiwi lays up to six eggs every year. Kiwi eggs are smooth and white, off-white, or pale
                green in
                color. They are also huge in comparison to the mother: one egg might reach up to 20 percent of her
                weight; that
                would be like a 120-pound (54 kilograms) human female giving birth to a 24-pound (11 kilograms)
                baby! Compared
                to the relative weights of other birds and their eggs, the female kiwi should weigh about 31 pounds
                (14
                kilograms) rather than its typical weight of 2 to 8 pounds (0.9 to 3.6 kilograms).
